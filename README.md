## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Nothing particularly new here, but was able to use the background property to get the image placed and taking up the entire space nicely.
- Nice to use percentages when adjusting fonts, this should strike a nice balance of allowing the user to maintain their preferences, and achieve the goals of the layout
- Mobile-first workflow is much easier to work with, usually only a few adjustments are needed to get a good desktop layout after changing the flex direction or adding grid columns.

### Continued development

- CSS Grid is still feeling somewhat unpredictable, but it is very useful for responsive layouts.
